### Project Description
StudySphere is a web-based academic productivity platform designed to help students plan smarter, avoid burnout, and stay motivated.
Built during a hackathon, this project combines productivity tools with emotional reinforcement to create a balanced academic ecosystem.

### The Problem statement

Students often struggle with:
- Poor study planning
- Burnout due to unrealistic goals
- Lack of peer collaboration
- Low motivation consistency


### The Solution
We solve academic burnout by combining smart workload calculation, burnout detection, motivational reinforcement, and peer matching into one dashboard, ensuring realistic study planning while maintaining mental well-being and long-term academic sustainability.
